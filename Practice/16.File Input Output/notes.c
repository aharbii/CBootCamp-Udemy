 * Volatile Memory:
 *      --> RAM:
 *          -> All this memory is lost when the program ends.
 *          -> Static
 *          -> Stack
 *          -> Heap
 * 
 * Permanent Storage:
 *      --> HDD:
 *          -> By including stdio.h you get a lot of functions to write and read data from permanent storage.
 *          -> Data is organized into objects called files.
 *          -> A file is a sequence of bytes you can process.
 *          -> A file is an abstraction: you don't need to know the details of the storage device you are using.
 * 
 *      --> File Streams:
 *          -> Stream: abstract representation of any external source or destination for data.
 *          -> Standard input, standard output, standard error
 *          -> File stream as text file
 *          -> File stream as binary file.
